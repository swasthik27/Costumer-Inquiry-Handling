# Costumer-Inquiry-Handling
This mini-project, "SOP-Customer Enquiry Handling," is designed to streamline and optimize the process of managing customer inquiries using Java technologies. The project focuses on developing a robust system that handles customer queries efficiently, ensuring a seamless experience for both the customer service team and the clients.
Implemented using Java, JDBC-MySQL, and Java Swing, the system facilitates smooth data management and user interaction. The application leverages JDBC for database connectivity to a MySQL backend, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of customer data and inquiries. The graphical user interface, built with Java Swing, offers an intuitive and user-friendly platform for customer service representatives to manage inquiries, assign them to appropriate departments, and track their status.
This system enhances communication and reduces response times by providing a structured approach to handling inquiries. Furthermore, the project emphasizes data integrity and security, ensuring that customer information is handled with the utmost care. By integrating SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) into the inquiry handling process, the project aims to maintain consistency and quality in customer service operations![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fdfdd5d-2265-49bb-860b-43f6da492674)
